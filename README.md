# Star Trail - Front-End

In this personal project, I built a social media where people can share and like suggestions of learning paths - which are called "trails".

Unfortunatelly, it ran out of funds to be on-line.

Good news is you can still test it locally, as it is open-source now!

P.S.: Don't forget to check out the [Back-End](https://github.com/Rodrigo-Facury/Star_Trail_Back_End) also, to get the full project! :D
